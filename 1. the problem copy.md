This is about the environmental impact of the apparel industry in general :
its impact in terms of natural ressources usage and the pollution generated, seen from the angle of Green House Gas emission and the bioderversity impact.

Different garnment imply different kind of harms to the environment, depending on whether its fiber are syntehtic or a natural, whether it can be recycled or not.
There are pross and cons for each fabric types.
Synthetic fabric have the advantage not to require much land and water for the raw material production, but their impact gets high during the phases of product usage and product end-of-life, as synthetic fabric are in the vast majority not biodegradable.



# 4% of global GHG emissions is produced by the fashion industry

The global fashion industry produced around 2.1 billion tonnes of GHG emissions in 2018, equalling 4% of the global total.
This is equivalent to the combined annual GHG emissions of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.

# Around 70% of the fashion industry’s emissions come from upstream activities such as materials production, preparation and processing. The remaining 30% come from downstream retail operations, the use-phase and end-of-use activities.

If the industry continues to embrace current decarbonisation initiatives at the current pace, emissions will be capped at around 2.1 billion tonnes a year by 2030, around the same as they are now. 
This would leave levels at nearly double the maximum required to stay on the 1.5-degree pathway.

**Microplastics** . Half a million tons of microfibers (which are a type of microplastic) end up in oceans every year.
An estimated 35 percent of primary microplastics in the world’s oceans originate from the washing of synthetic textiles.
Toxic chemicals in synthetic microfibers poison marine wildlife.

Plastic particles washed off from products such as synthetic clothes contribute up to 35% of the primary plastic that is polluting our oceans.

**End of life = Waste**. Only 12 percent of textile waste is downcycled (broken down into its component materials), and less than one percent is closed loop recycled.
Nearly three-fourths of textile waste is incinerated or ends up in landfills, which release pollutants into their surroundings and contribute to habitat loss.
Anywhere from 30 to 300 species per hectare may be lost during the development of just one landfill site.


# the problem with sytetic fiber

- During manufacturing : raw material production - crude oil extraction
- During usage : releasing of microplastic during whashes and wear-off the fabrics
- End of Life:  downcycling/incineration/landfills (in case no second-life exists)


# it gets worse with mixed material fabrics : the trouble with textile sorting.


# And this assumes materials can be recycled. But some material can not be ( or harldy so far) :  it is the case for elastane.
