<p>In winter 2021, I was living in a shared flat in Ivry-sur-Seine together with 3 guys, all entrepreneurs. They were the kind of folks always working on new projects: a new development language to master, a new machine to play with or something new to build... We were immersed in an atmosphere that nurtures creative ideas and makes you want to dive right in... </p>
<p>One of them had a 3D printing machine, an endler 3 pro. </p>
<h3>I started learning how to use this machine:  programing parametric design of 3D objects from scratch using OpenScad, then translating the design into something printable by the machine. </h3>
<p> I did many experimentations, starting with some fonctionnal things like hooks. I ended up printing a lot of hooks.</p>
  
<p>We were in the middle of the “2nd” (or 3rd ?) wave of Covid and the startup I had co-founded a year earlier was about to collapse. I found myself with some "free" time and in an the perfect environment for experimenting and learning:
I was in the right place to reflect on subjects that were dear to me, subjects that I had put aside for a while.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep using the 3D printer as I felt there was much more that could be done with it by diverting its use a little.</p>
<h3> But I also wanted to work on the topic of durable textiles, and more specifically on the search for alternative ways to obtain elasticity in textiles.</h3>
<p>So I thought of using the 3D printing machine as a companion and a technological ressources for my exploration. </p>

<p>But before going further, I need to provide a bit more context:</p>
<h3>It had been a couple of years since I was interested in natural fibers, especially linen and hemp.</h3>
<p>Starting around 2018, i voewed a sort of cult to these fibers and even visited fabric suppliers and manufacturing sites in China.
The fact it could be grown and transformed in Europe brought the opportunity for new local value-chain with higher added-value (possibly "bi-products").
The promise of new income sources for farmers thanks to these new "circuits-courts" I thought....</p>
<p>I saw the potential of these fibers for making denim, jakets, tshirt.</p>
<p>I started making my own clothes with linen and hemp fabrics i bought online (i was living in Shanghai at the time, and these fabrics were readily available on taobao). 
Pants, jakets, blouses : relative succes. </p>
<p>These early experiences correspond to the time when I started doing a lot of yoga, which led me to buy real yoga clothes : 
I gradually became a big fan of stretchy outfits, until I bought a pair of "jeggings" from my friend's Zodiac Active brand.
I liked sportswear more and more: indeed, my life in China was quite "active": a typical day consisted of going from the production plant to social events in the evening: by taking the metro, shared bike and cabs, I was always ready for action...</p>
<h3>A new question arose : how can i obtain the same "confort" as my sportswear clothes using linen or hemp ?</h3>
<p>I started experiementing sewing sports bra made out of knitted linen. It wasn't as stretchy as my lululemon one, but it worked for me.
Indeed, a jersey knit offers a little stretch. But I did nott think it could meet what was "expected" from most people in terms of confort.</p>

<p> Here is where I stood in 2021, when I re-opened the "pandora box".</p>
<p>I remained convinced that there was a lot to be done with natural fiber, but i could see the limitations where certain "confort" features are expected. </p>
<p> I knew knits could provide some level of "stretchiness" in garnmets but it was limited.</p>
<h3> Leggings, homewear, sports bra are, indeed, made from knitted fabrics, but they all had something else in commun: 
they all countained elastane.</h3>
<p>After some reasearch, I discovered that the notion of confort in garnment has radicaly evolved in the past decades (new uses of textiles, news features expected)
The activewear (sportswear) market has been rising year after year and has seen the outbreak of its new variant, the athleisure market, during the covid pandemic.
As of today, elastane (or spandex, lycra) has becomed compolsory in fiber mixes of these categories. </p>
<p>Spandex was invented during WWII by DuPont to respond to the growing demand of rubber combined with the newly need of women for comfortable and "stretchy" underwear. </p>

<p>Elastane brings the "stretchy property" to most current activewear and underwear produced today, extending up to 5-8 times its normal size and getting back to its orginial lenght.
It is mostly used in blend (from 1 to 40%) in garments.</p>
<p>In fact, I could find several "durable" activewear items made with organic cotton, recycled polyester, or even linen. Their comparative Life Cycle Analysis could feed another topic of research.
But most of them countain a small percentage or elasane. Put it differently, it is rare to find activewear clothes made of one single fiber. 
You can find a few 100% linen or 100% cotton knitted products but these items, to me, are not competing with the blended-ones in terms of performance.</p>

<h3> Beyond the environmental impacts linked to its manufacturing process, like any other synthetic polymer, the real issue with elastane is the sorting and recycling phase.</h3>

<p>With today's sorting and recycling infrastructure in place in France, the incorporation of elastane in a garnment, even in a small percentage, makes it almost impossible to be recycled.
</p>

<h3> This is why i decided to explore the possibilities to obtain "confortable" activewear made out of a single material, idealy one that is biobased or recycled. </h3>
