In winter 2021, I found myself with some "free" time. Time I spent experimenting on the search for altnernative ways to obtain elasticity in textiles.

But before going further, I need to provide a bit more context :
It had been a couple of years I was interested in natural fibers, especially linen and hemp.
Starting around 2018, i voewed a cult to these fibers and even visited some fabric suppliers and manufacturing sites in China (more details here).
The fact it could be grown and transformed in Europe brought the opportunity for new local value-chain with higher added-value (possibly "bi-products").
The promise of new sources of incomes for farmers thanks to these new "circuits-courts" I thought...
I saw the potential of these fibers for making denim, jakets, tshirt. 
I started making my own clothes with linen and hemp fabrics i bought online (i was living in Shanghai at the time, and these fabrics were easily availble on taobao). 
Pants, jakets, blouses : big succes. 
These first experiments matched the time I started buying proper yoga clothes : 
Meanwhile, I was becoming a big fan of stetchy outfits (that same year I bought a pair of "jeggings" from my friend's brand Zodiacactive ... )
A new question arrose : how can i obtain the same "confort" than my sportswear clothes using linen or hemp ?
I started experiementing sewing a sportbra made out of knitted linen. It wasn't as stretchy as my lululemon one but it worked for me.
Indeed, a jersey knit offers a little stretch. But I don't think it could meet what is currently "expected" from most people in terms of confort.

Here is where I stood in 2021, when I re-oped the "pandora box".
I was stuck with the idea that there was a lot to be done with natural fiber,
but i could see the limitation when certain "confort" features are expected. 
I knew knits could provide some level of "stretchiness" in garnmets but from what i could think of, this was limited.
Leggings, confortable homepants, sportsbras, are indeed, made from knitted fabrics, but they all had something else in commun: 
they all countained elastane.

After some reasearch, I discovered that the notion of confort in garnment has radicaly evolved in the past decades (new uses of textiles, news features expected)
The activewear (sportswear) market has been rising year after year and has seen the outbreak of its new variant, the athleisure market, during the covid pandemic.
As of today, elastane (or spandex, lycra) has almost becomed compolsory in fiber mixes of these categories. 

Spandex was invented during WWII by DuPont to respond to the growing demand of rubber combined with the newly need of women for comfortable and "stretchy" underwear.

Elastane brings *the stretchy property* to most current activewear and underwear produced today, extending up to 5-8 times its normal size and getting back to its orginial lenght.
It is mostly used in blend (from 1 to 40%) in garments.


In fact, I could find several "durable" activewear items made with organic cotton, recycled polyeter, or even linen. Their comparative Life Cycle Analysis could feed another topic of discussion.
But most of them countain a small percentage or elasane. Put it differently, it is rare to find activewear clothes made of one single fiber. 
You can find a few 100% linen or 100% cotton knitted products but these items, to me, are clearly not competing with the blended-ones in terms of performance.

Beyond the environmental impacts linked to its manufacturing process, 
like any other synthetic polymer, the real issue with elastane is the sorting and recycling phase.

With today's sorting and recycling infractuctures in place in France, the incorporation or elastane in a garnment, even in a small percentage, makes it almost impossible to be recycled.(see more details here)

We can ask ourself if a garnment can truly be "durable" when it is designed with the impossiblity to be recycled.

The ambition I gave to myself in winter 2021, was to search and experiement on an alternative to elastane, ideally monomaterial, which could be bring the same* property of "elasticity".
