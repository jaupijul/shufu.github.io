Elastane brings *the stretchy property* to most current activewear and underwear produced today, extending up to 5-8 times its normal size and getting back to its orginial lenght.


It is mostly used in blend (from 1 to 40%) in garments.

But so what is Elastane?

#  Elastane is ...

1. A polymer, amorphous, maintained above its glass transition temperature, so that considerable molecular reconformation, without breaking of covalent bonds, is feasible. 

2. with viscoelasticity (i.e., both viscosity and elasticity)
  - with weak intermolecular forces
  - with low Young's modulus
  - with high failure strain (compared with other materials)
 
= *an Elastomer*
 
3. Syntetic

Polyester being the number 1 fiber produced.
